I'm currently a guest researcher at [the University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/) specializing in applied cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies. My work focuses on zero-knowledge proofs and their applications. I have also worked on related topics such as multi-party computation (MPC) and homomorphic encryption (HE).

I'm also an experienced software developer with a strong background in implementing cryptographic protocols in Rust. Most notably, I have implemented collaborative CP-NIZK using Arkworks and various other protocols as described in my publications.

Next to research, I'm passionate about writing educational content and have experience in teaching and supervising students. I worked in teaching and supervising Computer Science students at the University of Groningen. The teaching materials and student project outcomes can be found under the teaching tab.

I did my PhD with the [Information Systems Group](https://www.cs.rug.nl/infosys/) at [the University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/), advised by [Prof. Dr. Dimka Karastoyanova](https://www.cs.rug.nl/infosys/Main/DimkaKarastoyanova) and [Dr. Fatih Turkmen](https://www.cs.rug.nl/infosys/Main/FatihTurkmen)

I earned a MSc. degree in Computer Science (Information Security and Privacy) from [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au/) in Melbourne Australia. Prior to that, I got my BSc. degree in Computer Science from the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/) in Auckland, New Zealand.
