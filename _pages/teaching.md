# University of Groningen
Department of Computer Science, 2020 - 2024

## Advanced Topics in Security and Privacy (MSc Course)  
* The course provides insight into some of the recent developments in security and privacy research. The lectures will cover various security/privacy topics including access control, Web security, differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computing, blockchain technology (DApps) with an emphasis on security aspects (e.g. smart contract security, verifiable credentials).

Teaching activities include:
- Lectures o the topics: decentralization, blockchain, smart contracts, and Self-Sovereign Identity. 
- Creating course assignments and projects, and evaluating the outcome.
- Creating and supervising the lab on blockchain and smart contracts security.
